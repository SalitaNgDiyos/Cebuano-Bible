Cebuano Ang Biblia, Bugna Version

Cebuano is the second most widely spoken native language of the Philippines. The complete Cebuano Bible was first published in 1917. This Bible is published today as the Ang Biblia, Cebuano by the Philippine Bible Society. Two separate versions are available: The 'Pinadayag' version contains a completely revised New Testament, the 'Bugna' version contains the original New Testament from 1917. Both versions share the same Old Testament text. The 'Bugna' designation is derived from the Cebuano name given to the book of Revelation. The New Testament text generally follows the same Greek Received Text, which was used as a basis for the King James Version. Because of its similarity with the KJV it is also called the Cebuano King James Version. This work is in the public domain.(Source: www.ccel.org)
